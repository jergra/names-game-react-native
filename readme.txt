React native wordle-type game from tutorial:
    WORDLE with React Native

We are guessing names instead of words.

start:
    npm start
    click 'tunnel', read QR code with Expo Go app

deployed:

    Use the Expo Go app to read the QR code at:

    https://expo.dev/@jergra43/names-game-react-native?serviceType=classic&distribution=expo-go
    https://expo.dev/@jergra43/names-game-react-native

    The react-native app code was adjusted to make a website version:
    https://names-game-react-native-web.vercel.app/
    https://github.com/jergra/names-game-react-native-web
    C:\dev\names-game-react-native-web

    Animation effects, using react-native-renanimated, 
    were added to the mobile-app version, but not here.
    React-native-renanimated seems not to be compatible with
    react-native-web.

    If the aim is to use react-native-web to have a website,
    it would be simpler and better to build it from scratch, 
    rather than adjust an already built mobile app.


update:
    expo publish

There is a copy of the code at github.
To keep this code up-to-date:
    git add .
    git commit -m "message"
    git push
