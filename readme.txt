React native wordle-type game from tutorial:
    WORDLE with React Native

We are guessing names instead of words.

start:
    npm start
    click 'tunnel', read QR code with Expo Go app

deployed:

    Use the Expo Go app to read the QR code at:

    https://expo.dev/@jergra43/names-game-react-native?serviceType=classic&distribution=expo-go
    https://expo.dev/@jergra43/names-game-react-native

    The react-native app code was adjusted to make a website version:
    https://names-game-react-native-web.vercel.app/
    https://github.com/jergra/names-game-react-native-web
    C:\dev\names-game-react-native-web

    If the aim is to use react-native-web to have a website,
    it would be simpler and better to build, with that aim,
    from scratch, rather than adjust an already built mobile
    app, as we did here.


update:
    expo publish
